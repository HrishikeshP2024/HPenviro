              1. E-WASTE MANAGEMENT
We provide advice on E-waste management, any doubts you might have with respect to E-waste management, you can contact one of us and clarify your doubts. We also provide free articles educating people on E-waste and the right steps we have to take as humans to take care of our homes.</h3>

2. WEEKLY MEETINGS
There will be weekly meetings where we discuss the effects of pollution and plan out a roadmap for the week. We will follow this roadmap throughout the week This would include picking out the trash from public places and recycle it, going on protests to spread the word about the growing pollution in the cities.</h3>
<h3 class= hhh>
3. TREE PLANTATIONS
Every Sunday, as a collective group, we will go on a tree plantation spree for a few hours. During this time we will plant different types of trees on government-approved lands. The location each time would be different and would be a memorable and satisfying experience for everyone involved. All this while improving our environment and building ourselves a better future.</h3>

                  The legal definition of a naturally occurring chemical is a chemical occurring in a natural environment that is extracted without chemical change by manual, mechanical or gravitational means; or dissolution in water; or flotation; or a process of heating for the sole purpose of removing uncombined water
                  
                  The 5 most common chemicals in nature are Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4), Ethylene (C2H4), Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) , Propylene (C3H6) and Nitrogen.
                  
                  A solution for this would be to avoid using blocking or protecting groups or any temporary modifications if possible. Derivatives use additional reagents and generate waste.
